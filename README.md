# HousingPredictionModel

# Introduction
This model is designed to predict sales prices accurately using advanced regression techniques. The goal is to solve the problem of price estimation by applying sophisticated algorithms, which can handle complex relationships within the data and prevent overfitting. The project is ideal for applications where accurate predictions of continuous values, like property sales prices, are critical. It incorporates domain-relevant features that improve the modelâ€™s predictive power by capturing variations in key factors affecting prices, such as property characteristics and market trends.

# Target Variable
The target variable in this project is the "Sales Price," representing the continuous numeric outcome the model is trained to predict. By analyzing relationships between the sales price and input features (such as property size, number of rooms, and age), the model learns to predict future sales prices with precision. This understanding allows the model to provide valuable price predictions that reflect real-world property values and market trends.
